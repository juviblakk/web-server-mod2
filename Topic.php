    <h3>Web Server</h3>
    <p>
        A web server is computer software and underlying hardware that accepts requests via HTTP (the network protocol created to 
        distribute web content) or its secure variant HTTPS. A user agent, commonly a web browser or web crawler, initiates communication by 
        making a request for a web page or other resource using HTTP, and the server responds with the content of that resource or an error 
        message. A web server can also accept and store resources sent from the user agent if configured to do so
